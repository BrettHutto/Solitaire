# Solitaire

The point of this project is to make solitaire in the web browser, to get more practice with Javascript/CSS/HTML, and to build up to another project, Frontlines, 
which is a card game that I developed along with a few classmates for an assignment, but was never implemented outside of an anolog method.

This program should be able to handle the following:
  Play conventional Solitaire.
  Be able to play completely offline in a web browser.
  Be able to run in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox with no issues.
  Tell the player when they have won the game.
  No major issues with game mechanics or UI.
  
There are probably plenty of extra things that I could add to this project, but I know if I don't state what a good stopping point is, I probably
won't ever be satified with stopping in the first place.
